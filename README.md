# project

The STM32WL55CCU6 long-range wireless and ultra-low-power devices embed a powerful and ultra-low-power LPWAN-compliant radio solution, enabling the following modulations: LoRa¬Æ, (G)FSK, (G)MSK, and BPSK.

STM32WL55CCU6 256-Kbyte flash memory, 64-Kbyte SRAM

# examples

For more information about the examples, see the README.md file in the examples directory.

Note that when using `UART` to view the log, the baud rate is `9600`.

Refer to the STM32CubeMX resource pack for more example. It is usually under path `C:\Users\user\STM32Cube\Repository\STM32Cube_FW_WL_V1.x.0\Projects`

# firmware

The factory firmware in `T3_STM32_Firmware\xxx.hex` is generated using `examples\6_SubGHz_TXRX`, the only difference between them is transceiver and frequency.

Other firmware can be downloaded at `examples\[project]\MDK-ARM\[project]\[project].hex`

# download

There are many ways to download the program, `jlink`, `stlink`, `UART`;

Note that before using `jlink` or `stlink` to download the program, you should install the corresponding driver.
